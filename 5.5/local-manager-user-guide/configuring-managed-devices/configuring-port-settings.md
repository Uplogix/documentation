<!-- 5.4 -->

Each port has a set of parameters that control interactions with the device it manages. You can define file transfer methods and priorities, configure file save method, wait time during device reboots, and so forth. These are the settings applied during the assimilation process, which fine-tunes the device settings for optimum performance.

The factory default settings for the Local Manager represent common industry practices, but your environment may require customized settings.

To access port settings, use the interactive **config settings** command. Each entry in the settings list is accessed by entering the number associated with that entry.

# Most Frequently Used

## Option 7 - Automatic Rollback Configuration

Defines whether the Local Manager automatically rolls back uncommitted configuration changes on a managed device. Available options are *disabled*, *manual*, and *automatic*.

### Disabled

If Automatic Rollback is disabled, no running configurations are pulled, hence no changes are determined or presented.

### Manual (default)

In this mode, the configuration is pulled prior to the **terminal** command (dependent on Option 24). After the **terminal** session, the configuration is pulled again. The user is presented with a list of the changes made during the session.

```
Disconnecting ...

Logging out of device...
Attempting to retrieve configuration using the console...
Complete. running-config pulled.
running-config saved to archive as current.

Changes made in current terminal session: 
+hostname HOU-CORE
-hostname AUS-CORE
```

To roll back the changes manually, use the **rollback config** command.

```
[admin@UplogixLM (port1/1)]# rollback config
Retrieving running-config from device ...
Complete. running-config pulled.

Transferring via XModem.
Initiating file transfer
Transferring file ...

Sent staging-running-config (43 bytes) at 121 B/s.

File staging-running-config was transferred to the device successfully via XModem.
staging-running-config copied to running-config
Retrieving running-config from device ...
Complete. running-config pulled.
running-config saved to archive as current.
Rollback successful.
running 'write memory'
Retrieving running-config from device ...
Complete. running-config pulled.
running-config saved to archive as current.
```

### Automatic

Similar to Manual mode, except that after changes are shown to a user, a countdown begins.

```
Changes made in current terminal session: 
+hostname HOU-CORE
-hostname AUS-CORE

Warning: Automatic rollback in effect.
Any changes to the device's running-config will be restored in 75 seconds.
75  seconds remaining. ([C]ommit/[P]ostpone/[R]ollback immediately):
```

If a user is disconnected during the **terminal** session or during the rollback countdown, the configuration is immediately rolled back. 

```
Warning: Automatic rollback in effect.
Any changes to the device's running-config will be restored in 75 seconds.
1  seconds remaining. ([C]ommit/[P]ostpone/[R]ollback immediately):
Rolling back changes to running-config...
```

## Option 21 - Device pass through timeout

Users can be automatically logged out of **terminal** sessions if they are idle too long. Specify a max idle time in seconds. The user will be presented with a warning message when half of the idle time has expired.

```
Console session started.  Press ~[ENTER] to exit.


AUS-CORE#

You have been idle for 150 seconds. Your session will end in 150 seconds.
```

When the full timer expires, the user will be logged out. If Automatic Rollback is in effect, any changes made during the session will be undone.

```
You have been idle for 300 seconds, your session is ending.

Retrieving running-config from device ...

running-config saved to archive as current.
