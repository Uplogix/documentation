The keypad located on the front panel provides up, down, left, and right keys (labeled with arrows) as well as enter/power (i.e., the middle key) and back keys. The left and right arrow keys move the cursor left and right, respectively. The up and down arrow keys change numerical values.

Press the Enter/Power key in the center of the keypad to power the Local Manager on when it is powered off. When the Local Manager is powered on, press the Enter/Power key in the center of the keypad to display the menu. The menu functions include:

**Configure**

Covers the steps needed to work with the Local Manager via an SSH session. Equivalent to the following commands: **config system ip**, **config system management**, and **config system pulse**.

**Restart**

Reboots the Local Manager. Equivalent to the **restart** command
 
**Shutdown**

Powers off the Local Manager. Equivalent to the **shutdown** command

**Update**

**Factory reset**

Press the Back key below the left arrow key to exit the menu and resume scrolling status information.
