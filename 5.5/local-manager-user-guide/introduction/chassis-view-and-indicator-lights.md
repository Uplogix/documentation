The Uplogix 3200 may be customized by adding additional ports through the two modular expansion bays.

The leftmost bay in the 3200 is designated slot 1 in the system and the rightmost bay as slot 2. Each expansion bay can be used to add either four, eight or sixteen serial ports or four, eight or sixteen dedicated Ethernet ports. Dedicated Ethernet ports are paired with serial ports to enhance management capabilities for some devices by providing direct Ethernet connections between the Local Manager and the managed devices.
