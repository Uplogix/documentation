# Safety Summary

Following all cautions and warnings will ensure your own safety and protect the Local Manager from potential damage or loss of data.

<div class='warning' />Read all installation instructions before connecting the Local Manager to a power source.</div>

Read and understand the following instructions before using the Local Manager:

* Use three wire electrical extension cords with a current rating equal to or greater than the Local Manager's current rating.
* Always disconnect the Local Manager from power before cleaning and servicing.
* Do not spray liquids directly onto the Local Manager when cleaning. Always apply the liquid first to a static free cloth.
* Do not immerse the Local Manager in any liquid or place any liquids on it.
* Do not disassemble the Local Manager. Hazardous voltages are present inside the Uplogix 5000 system and can result in injury or death. To reduce the risk of shock and to maintain the warranty on the device, a qualified technician must perform service or repair work.
* Connect the Local Manager to a grounded outlet. 
* Only connect the Local Manager to surge-protected power outlets.

# Uplogix Glossary

## Archive

Local Managers send bulk data, such as: session logs, change logs, and all other non-urgent statistical data to the Control Center every 60 minutes (default) using an encrypted HTTPS proprietary data communication protocol on port 8443.

## Heartbeat

Local Managers communicate with the Control Center every 30 seconds (default) using a secure HTTPS proprietary communication protocol on TCP port 8443. Device state, alarms, events and configuration parameters are sent during a heartbeat.

## Local Manager (LM)

A Local Management device that is directly connected to managed network devices and servers.

## Pulse

Used by the Local Manager to determine network connectivity by sending data to an echo server on TCP port 7 (echo) every 30 seconds. Up to three may be defined to determine failure.

## Uplogix 500

Uplogix 500 Local Manager appliance is a compact, fixed 6-port model that an be used to manage 5 devices and one switched power controller.

## Uplogix 5000

Uplogix 5000 Local Manager appliance is a modular chassis model with higher port density that can scale to manage 21 directly connected devices and one switched power controller.

## Control Center (UCC)

Centralized element manager for all Local Managers and their managed devices deployed throughout the network. The web-based graphical user interface (GUI) enables IT administrators to easily view, manage, configure and control all network devices and servers connected to Local Managers and supplies access to real time data from these devices. The Control Center is also the integration point for all remotely collected data and diagnostics for upstream delivery to NMS tools such as Solarwinds, HP OpenView, CA Spectrum and Tivoli Netcool.
