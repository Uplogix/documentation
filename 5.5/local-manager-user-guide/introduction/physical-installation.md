# Install a temperature and humidity sensor

Environmental monitoring is available via a USB-connected temperature and humidity sensor.

Follow these steps to connect the sensor. Note the Local Manager does not need to be powered down for installation of this sensor.

1.	Plug the sensor into one of the two USB connections on the Local Manager.
2.	Place sensor collection end in the area you wish to collect environmental information, ideally not near a fan or on hot equipment.

It may take up to 10 minutes for the sensor to normalize to the environmental temperature and begin reporting consistent data. 

# Install expansion cards

Please see the following documents for more information about expansion cards:

* [Expansion Cards](http://uplogix.com/docs/local-manager-user-guide/introduction/expansion-cards)

Use the following procedure to install or replace an expansion card.

<div class='warning'>Always power off the Local Manager before installing or removing expansion cards.</div>

1.	Power off the Local Manager.
2.	Using a #2 Philips screwdriver, loosen the module screws securing the blank faceplate or the option card to be replaced and remove it.
3.	Slide the new or replacement option card into place. Ensure the two module retention screws are threaded into the faceplate of the card. The screws will align to holes in the chassis if the screws are slightly backed out of the front panel. 
<div class='info'>Installing the option card with the screws fully engaged makes it difficult to install the card properly.</div> 

4.	Look inside the chassis and find two tabs close to the front of the option slot and two located further back. Place the rear edge of the card on the two front tabs, tilt the card up and slide it back so the card edges slide below the two rear tabs. Gently push the card back until the card seats in the connector on the backplane.
<div class='warning'>If it is difficult to slide the card or if the card resists being properly seated, the card is probably not installed correctly. Remove the card and start over. Very little force is required to install the cards.</div>

5.	Tighten the module retention screws to ensure that the internal connector seats properly. 
<div class='warning'>Over tightening the screws may strip the threads and is not required; finger tight is sufficient. As you install the retention screws, you may encounter some resistance. If needed, use a #2 Philips screwdriver to overcome this resistance but use care not to cross thread or strip the screw.</div>
6.	If you are installing a 16 port serial card, attach the supplied octopus cable to the connector on the front of the card.
