In this example we will copy an OS file from the Uplogix file directory to a Cisco ASA Firewall.


Navigate to the port the device is connected to and temrinal in.
```

Enable the interactive SCP server by typing **~g** (the Uplogix escape character tilde with the letter g).

```

```                                                                                                                                                                               
Enter the device's SCP (or SFTP) commands on the device. In this example we use the dedicated IP address as the host.

```

```                                 
For Source filename, the syntax is **/port/category/version/filename** with and underscore (_) in the port name. See [The Uplogix File System](https://uplogix.com/docs/local-manager-user-guide/configuring-managed-devices/uplogix-file-system "The Uplogix File System") for more info on the different files for managed devices.

### To copy a file from the network device to the Local Manager, reverse the commands:
```
CISCO_FIREWALL# copy flash: scp:
