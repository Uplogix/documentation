Use the **push** command to write a saved configuration to a device.

Whether you write the entire configuration or make incremental changes, the procedure is:

1. Pull the current running configuration from the device by logging into the device with the **terminal** command.
2. Verify that the configuration file you intend to push is the correct file.
3. Push the file using either the **push startup-config** or the **push running-config** command. 
 
The Local Manager will pull the configuration before and after the push operation, so the change can be undone if necessary.

Use **push startup-config** to write the entire configuration (e.g., replacing a device). For the case of a device with a VLAN database, also use **push vlan** to restore the VLAN database (vlan.dat) file.

Use the **push running-config** command to make incremental changes. In the example below, the running-config candidate file contains only one line; when this running-config file is pushed to the device, only its hostname will be changed.

First, log into the device with the **terminal** command. The Local Manager automatically pulls the current running-config so it can track changes made during the terminal session, which are required for the rollback feature and device change logging. 

```

The **show running-config** command displays the device's current configuration. Some information has been removed from the command output.

The Local Manager pulls the running configuration again as the terminal session ends.

Using the **show running-config** candidate command, view the running configuration file that you will push to the device.

```
[dsmith@UplogixLM (port1/1)]# show running-config candidate
hostname foo
```

This running configuration file will only change the device hostname. To push this configuration to the device, use the **push running-config candidate** command.

```
[dsmith@UplogixLM (port1/1)]# push running-config candidate
Retrieving running-config from device ...

When the file transfer is complete, view the new running configuration using the **show running-config current** command. Some information has been removed from the command output.
