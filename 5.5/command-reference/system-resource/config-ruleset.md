# Usage

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config ruleset interfaceDefault
description Default Ethernet Ruleset

Example 2:

```
[config ruleset rulesetOne]# rule1, rule2 |rule 3, rule 4
```

Rule 1 will be evaluated, and if it does not match, rule 2 and rule 3 will both be evaluated. If neither rule 2 or 3 match, rule 4 is evaluated.
