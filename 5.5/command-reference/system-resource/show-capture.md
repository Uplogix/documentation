To export the capture file in pcap format, use **show capture â€“pcap** and pipe it to SCP, FTP, or Email.

To export via SCP, use the following syntax:

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# show capture -pcap | scp uplogix@192.0.2.226:uplogixlm.cap1
uplogix@192.0.2.226's password:*******
..
File successfully sent to 192.0.2.226.
copy succeeded
```
In the above example, the capture file will be attached to the email with the filename uplogixlm.cap1. The file can then be viewed in any third party application capable of reading pcap files (Wireshark, etc.).

To export the capture file in plain text with SCP, FTP, or Email, simply omit the â€“pcap option.
