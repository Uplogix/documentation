Interactive command to set the alarm threshold for ambient temperature (32-port Uplogix Local Managers) or for temperature and humidity (older 4-port Uplogix Local Managers). This command is not available for the Uplogix 430, 500, or  5000 Local Manager.

# Usage 

32-port Uplogix Local Managers ship with an external 1-Wire&#8482; temperature sensor; older 4-port Local Managers have a temperature and humidity sensor built in. 

Exceeding temperature or humidity thresholds (if applicable) will trigger alarms. If environmental data is unavailable - for example, if the sensor has not been connected - the corresponding alarm(s) will not be triggered.

```
