# Overview 

The Control Center can aggregate alarms and events from all Local Managers in the deployment. Which alarms and events a user can view will depend on the user's privileges.

# Alarms (Deployment)

<div class='ucc' />Alarms</div>

The Alarms page provides a quick overview of active alarms on any of the managed Local Managers.

The alarm summary shows when an alarm was last generated, how long it has been active, which Local Manager it occurred on, and a message detailing the alarm. If the alarm involves a specific device and/or interface, that information is displayed as well. Alarms can be filtered by Local Manager, and by number of results. To quickly access the Local Manager reporting the alarm, click the hostname in the Local Manager column to bring up the Local Manager detail page.
