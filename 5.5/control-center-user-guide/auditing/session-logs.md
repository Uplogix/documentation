# Overview

<div class='ucc' />Inventory > Local Manager Summary > Session Logs</div>

Every command line interaction between a user and the Local Manager is logged and subsequently archived on both the Local Manager and the Control Center. To view archived sessions, click *Session Logs* from the left menu of the Local Manager Summary page.

# Viewing Session Logs

A list of archived sessions by user can be displayed, just as with the CLI command **show sessions**. Select the user from the list and click *Display Sessions*. To view the details of a listed session, click *Display Session* to the right of the timestamp. This is equivalent to the show session command.

Session information is updated every 30 seconds on the Local Manager, but the actual recorded transaction is transferred during the archive process which happens every hour by default.

Session details are not available for sessions in progress.
