# Basic Settings

![Uplogix Control Center Login Page](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/UCC-Basic-Settings-5.5.2-2.jpg)

## Login Banner

Specify the text to display in the Control Center login screen. Line breaks entered in this text box are ignored. 

![Uplogix Control Center Login Page](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/uplogix-control-center-login-window-5.5.jpg)

Use only printing characters in the banner and other text fields. Spaces are considered printing characters.

## Session Timeout

By default, Control Center sessions time out after 30 minutes of inactivity. If this does not meet your organization's needs, change the value for Session timeout. You can set the timeout to any integer value from 5 to 1440 minutes (24 hours).

Once finished making changes, click **Save**.

The session timeout for Local Managers is set separately. 

> If your session times out, you will be logged out but any operation in progress will not be affected. When you log in again, you are returned to the same page.

## Time Zone

<div class='danger'>Correct Control Center time is critical and should be provided by an NTP server. </div>

Setting the time zone does not change the system time of the Control Center. This setting is only used for display purposes. The Uplogix Control Center should always be set to UTC time.

## Use DST

Select *Use DST* to adjust Daylight Saving time in reporting.

# Mail Settings

See *[Configuring Mail Settings](http://uplogix.com/docs/control-center-user-guide/managing-the-control-center/mail-settings)*.

# Reverse SSH Tunnel Settings

See *[Configuring Reverse SSH Tunnels](http://uplogix.com/docs/control-center-user-guide/managing-the-control-center/reverse-ssh-tunnels)*.

# SNMP Settings

![Uplogix Control Center SNMP Settings](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/5.4/uplogix-control-center-server-settings-snmp.png)

The Control Center can be configured to send SNMP traps to an SNMP manager. Traps collected from Local Managers will be sourced with the Local Manager's IP address.

SNMP MIB definitions are available under /home/emsadmin on the Control Center.
