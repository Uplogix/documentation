Anonymous Usage Statistics collects data to help our developers better understand how the Control Center is used and prioritize improvement requests. **No personally identifiable data is collected.** The data consists of anonymous information related to the usage of the Control Center, for example, total count of each item (ex. alarm count, user count, or size used by file archive). The data is collected nightly as a server process.
