# Overview

This functionality allows users to connect to a modem pool (or remote access server) to dial into Local Managers.

Requirements for using this capability are:

* The Local Manager uses a circuit switched modem such as V.92 or Iridium.
* The Local Manager has been configured to accept incoming calls, and a list of permitted source phone numbers has been defined. These settings are configured with the **config answer** command.

In the example below, a Cisco router is configured as a Remote Access Server (RAS) for the Dial Applet to connect to the Local Manager. From the Local Manager's Out-of-Band configuration menu, select *Modem* and configure settings under the *Modem Pool* section.

* **Protocol** - choose telnet or SSH. Select SSH will enable authentication fields.
* **Host** - IP address or DNS Name of the RAS. 
* **Port Range** - Port range assigned by host for remote access, or the ports on the access server that map to the modems.
* **Username, Password** - Required if using SSH as the connection protocol
* **Allowed SSH Fingerprints** - Add the RAS' SSH fingerprint to protect against IP spoofing.
* **Phone Number** - Enter the command for dialing (ATDI/ATDT/ATD) and the phone number with no spaces.
* **Init String** - Enter an optional initialization string with no spaces.

Once the access server information has been configured (in the Remote Access Server section), a blue Dial button appears in the Control Center. Click the Dial button to connect to the Local Manager via out-of-band, circuit switched phone number.

The Control Center Dial applet connects to the modem server with the information pre-programmed in the RAS section of the Local Manager Modem configuration.
