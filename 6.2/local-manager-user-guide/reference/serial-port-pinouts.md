Local Manager console ports support a DCE pin-out. This includes both the management console port and the serial ports found on option cards.

![Serial Pin Out](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/lm-user-guide/Uplogix-Serial-Port-DCE-Pin-Out.png)

To connect the Local Manager's serial ports to a managed device with a DTE pin-out, use a **straight-through** cable.

To connect the Local Manager's serial ports to a managed device with a DCE pin-out (including the console port of another LM), use a **rolled** cable.
