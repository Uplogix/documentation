# Overview

There are a few utilities in LMS 6.2 that may be useful during everyday use.

# View Disk Usage

You can get an overview of the disk usage on a Local Manager by running the **show directory** command from the system resource.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# show directory

port1/2: 51.7 MB in 11 files.
port1/3: 141.7 KB in 19 files.

# Set CLI Page Length

By default, the Local Manager automatically determines the appropriate number of lines to display in the CLI window before providing a scroll prompt. If the appropriate page length cannot be determined, the CLI displays 24 lines before presenting a scroll prompt.

To change the number of lines displayed, use the **config system page-length** command:

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config system page-length
Page length preference is auto.
Change this? (y/n) [n]: y
Page length preference (2 or more lines or auto):15
```

In this example, the command line will display 15 lines before prompting you to press a key to scroll the display.
