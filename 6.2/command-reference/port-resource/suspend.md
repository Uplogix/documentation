```
Modem, Port:

- **all** - Suspends all data collection and automated processes for the port.
- **automated** - Suspends all but recovery-oriented processes such as configuration rollback and ROMmon detection.
- **recovery** - Suspends only automated recovery and config rollback. Data collection and alerting will continue 
- **-duration** - Set the suspend duration in minutes. Default is 60 minutes.

# Usage  

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# suspend
Local Manager automated operations suspended for 60 minutes
```
```
[admin@UplogixLM (port1/1)]# suspend recovery -duration 100
port1/1 is suspended for 100 minutes.
All recovery operations are suspended: rommon, config recovery, etc.
Terminal pass-through configuration rollback is suspended.
```
```
[admin@UplogixLM (port1/1)]# suspend
port1/1 is suspended for 60 minutes.
All scheduled jobs are suspended.  Log collection is suspended.
```
To resume normal operations before the suspend command times out, use the suspend command to reset the suspend duration - for example, **suspend -duration 1** causes normal operation to resume after one minute.
