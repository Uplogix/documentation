Interactive command to configure the auxiliary Ethernet port.  Configuration defaults to bonded (Layer2).  Choices for the secondary Ethernet include bonded, capture and outband.

Bonded selection will fail over within milliseconds.  Fail back will require 30 seconds.

If the selection is capture, the switchport should be configured as a port mirror directed to a specific VLAN or Ethernet port to be analyzed.

Outband will enable the interface when outband operations are proceeding, and bring the interface down when they are suspended.
