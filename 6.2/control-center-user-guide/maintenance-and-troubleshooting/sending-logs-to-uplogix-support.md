If you contact Uplogix Technical Support about an issue with the Control Center, the technical support staff may ask you to send log files. The Send Logs section on the Support Tools page provides a convenient way to do this.

If your Control Center is configured to send mail, you can use the ***Send Logs*** button. Otherwise, you can use the ***Download Logs*** button to download the logs to your desktop and then use your preferred mail client to send them to support@uplogix.com.
