# Overview

To provide subscribed information, alerts and reports, the Control Center must be configured to send email. For more information, see [Mail Settings](https://uplogix.com/docs/control-center-user-guide/managing-the-control-center/mail-settings "Mail Settings").

To receive alerts from Local Managers and reports from the Control Center, the user account must be:

- configured with an email address where alerts from the Local Managers and reports from the Control Center can be received
- subscribed to the desired alerts and reports

To audit other accounts, the account must be:

- configured with an email address where alerts and reports are received from the Control Center
- configured to audit at least one other account
- subscribed to the appropriate session report (hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly) for the account to be audited

These can be configured on the Create/Edit User or Create/Edit Group pages. Click the right arrows   to expand the collapsed sections of these pages.

# Configuring an Account to Receive Email

<div class='ucc' />Administration > Users > Username > Edit User</div>

For an account to receive alerts (from Local Managers) or reports (from the Control Center) by email, at least one email address where the user can receive alerts and reports (including user audits) must be entered.

Edit a user account and click *Add* under *Email Addresses*.

![Uplogix Control Center - Add Email](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/6.0/uplogix-control-center-add-email.png)

The in-band and out-of-band settings only apply to information that Local Managers email to you. By default, the address entered is used in both situations.

Select *Terse* to limit the message to a subject line only. Use the Terse setting for email directed to a pager or cell phone. Click *Add Email* when all the email information has been entered and then *Save* on the edit user details screen.

> To remove an email address, use the *Remove* button rather than manually clearing the address field.

# Configuring the account to audit others and to be audited

To receive some reports, a user account must be set up to audit other accounts. Learn more about it under Auditing > [Users](http://uplogix.com/docs/control-center-user-guide/auditing/users)

# Subscribing to alerts

<div class='ucc' />Administration > Users > Username > Edit</div>
