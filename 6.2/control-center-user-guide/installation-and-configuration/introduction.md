# Overview
The Uplogix Control Center (UCC) enables out-of-band management by providing a centralized point of control for all Uplogix Local Managers and through this, of managed devices deployed throughout your distributed IT environment. With its web-based graphical user interface (GUI), the Control Center puts IT administrators in control of real-time data to easily manage, configure, and control all network devices and servers connected to Uplogix Local Managers.

The Uplogix Control Center is deployed on a pre-configured, dual CPU, rack-mountable server, and includes an embedded Oracle database engine. It is also available as a VM to run on a customer-provider server. Consult with Uplogix Professional Services for minimum requirements for a UCC VM installation.
