With the exception of the Uplogix 430, all Local Manager console ports support a DCE pin-out. This includes both the management console port and the serial ports found on option cards.

To connect the Local Manager's serial ports to a managed device with a DTE pin-out, use a **straight-through** cable.

To connect the Local Manager's serial ports to a managed device with a DCE pin-out (including the console port of another LM), use a **rolled** cable.
