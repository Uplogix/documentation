# Overview

The purpose of this document is to detail the installation and configuration of an Uplogix Local Managers (LM) to facilitate remote connectivity to a KG Encryptor.

# Features
* Supports KG-175A Encryptors with Uplogix Local Manager
* Supports KG-175D Encryptors with Uplogix Local Manager with dedicated Ethernet card installed

# Physical Connection

## KG-175A 

Connect a free serial port on the Uplogix to the KG-175A's RS-232 console management port with a standard Cat-5 cable and a RJ45-to-DB9 connector. 

## KG-175D
Connect the Uplogix LM's corresponding Ethernet port to the KG-175D's front-panel-mounted
 Ethernet Port provided for the Console with a standard Cat-5 cable.

> A dedicated Ethernet connection is required for Ethernet port forwarding.  This type of connection is supported on an Uplogix LM with an installed dedicated Ethernet card.

# Configuring the Ports

## KG-175A 

To configure the LM for connection to a KG-175A, run the command **config init** and follow the prompts as below:

```
[admin@UplogixLM (port1/4)]# config init
--- Enter New Values ---
description: KG-175A
make [native]: 
management IP: 
Configure dedicated ethernet port? (y/n) [n]: n
Serial Bit Rate [9600]: 
Serial Data Bit [8]: 
Serial Parity [none]: 
Serial Stop Bit [1]: 
Serial Flow Control [none]: 
Use null modem (rolled cable to device)? (y/n) [n]: 
Do you want to commit these changes? (y/n): y
```
The default console settings for the KG-175A are 9600 bit rate, 8 serial data bit, no serial parity, serial stop bit 1, no flow control.

## KG-175D 

To configure the Uplogix LM for connection to a KG-175A, run the command **config init** and **config protocol forward** and follow the prompts as below:

```
[admin@UplogixLM (port1/4)]# config init
--- Enter New Values ---
description: KG-175D
make [native]: 
management IP: 
Configure dedicated ethernet port? (y/n) [n]: y
Use DHCP? (y/n) [n]: n
Each dedicated port IP address assignment must be on a different network.
The device IP assignment and port IP assignment should be on the same network for this port.
dedicated device IP: 172.16.0.1
dedicated port IP: 172.16.0.2
dedicated netmask: 255.255.255.0
speed/duplex [auto]: 
Serial Bit Rate [9600]: 
Serial Data Bit [8]: 
Serial Parity [none]: 
Serial Stop Bit [1]: 
Serial Flow Control [none]: 
Use null modem (rolled cable to device)? (y/n) [n]: 
Do you want to commit these changes? (y/n): y
```

To configure the Local Manager to pass web traffic to the KG-175A's web interface, run the **config protocol forward** command as below and enter **dedicated 80 http** to set the TCP port to which traffic will be passed on the device's dedicated IP address (172.16.0.1, entered above).

```
[admin@UplogixLM (port1/4)]# config protocol forward
[forward]# dedicated 80 http
[forward]# exit
```

# Connecting to the Encryptor

## KG-175A 

To connect to the serial console of the KG-175A, first connect to the Uplogix LM using SSH, navigate to the port that the KG-175A is connected to, and use the **terminal** command. When finished, use **~ <ENTER>** to disconnect.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# port 1/4
native
        KG-175A

[admin@UplogixLM (port1/4)]# terminal
Press ~[ENTER] to exit.
Connecting ...
Console session started.  Press ~[ENTER] to exit.
Console session ended.
Disconnecting ...
```

## KG-175D

The methodology for connecting to the web interface of a KG-175D varies slightly depending on the SSH client being used.
 
To use the SSH applet in the Uplogix Control Center's GUI, click the CLI button for the Uplogix LM, log in with valid credentials, click Terminal > Forward, click the check box next to the KG-175D's port, then click Apply.

A connection to the KG-175D's web interface can now be achieved by opening a web browser on your workstation and entering **127.0.0.1:[port]** in the address bar, where [port] is the port highlighted in green (6252 in the above example). The port is selected randomly when Apply is pressed, but can also be set manually by entering a port number and pressing Apply.
