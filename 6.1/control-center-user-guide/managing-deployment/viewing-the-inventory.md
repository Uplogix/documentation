![Uplogix Control Center Inventory](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/6.0/uplogix-control-center-inventory.png)
 
The current organization of your deployment is shown, including inventory groups and individual Local Managers. Initially, the Inventory list shows only the two default groups, *Your Company* and *Unassigned*. Additional groups will be sorted alphabetically. 

To search for a specific Local Manager, use the Search box in the Navigation bar and enter a hostname or serial number.

To view the contents of an inventory group, click the expand icon to the left of the inventory group name. To view the group details, click the group name and the group detail page displays. All functions concerning inventory groups can be accessed from the group detail page.

A gray icon indicates the group is empty.

The icons beside each entry denote status or other information.
