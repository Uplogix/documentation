# Uplogix Control Center

Currently, the Control Center does not support push-button upgrading. Upgrades are handled by Uplogix Support staff with appointments available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Software is provided here for download prior to a scheduled Uplogix-assisted upgrade.

<div class='danger' />An improper upgrade can result in the loss of data and cause the Control Center to stop functioning.</div>

# Upgrade Paths

The following upgrade paths have been tested and approved by Uplogix. If the minimum version requirement is not met, data may be lost or the Local Manager may fail to boot.

<div class='warning' />If your Local Manager is not on the minimum version, you will need to upgrade multiple times.</div>
