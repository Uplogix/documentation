## New for 5.4

Prior to 5.4, the **terminal** command made use of the **use system auth** privilege to automatically log users into the managed device (if the port was configured with an advanced driver and the authentication credentials stored). As a result, when users ran **terminal**, they were presented with the privileged-mode CLI of the managed device.

In 5.4, the **use system auth** privilege has been denied by default. Now, when running the **terminal** command, the Local Manager will log out of the managed device before handing control of the CLI to the user.

> Pre-existing roles, groups, and users are not affected by this change. The appropriate permission was automatically re-added during the upgrade to 5.4.

# Usage 

To start a terminal session with a device, navigate to the appropriate port and issue the **terminal** command. You may be prompted to log into the device. Terminal commands available are role-based and port-specific.

If the terminal is in use, the system returns the message:

```
Terminal pass-through is in use. Press 'x' to exit, 'f' to force break 
```
The terminal pass-through feature blocks all automated Uplogix Local Manager processes while active. It times out in five minutes to allow automated processes to continue.

The transactional configuration rollback automatically generates a rollback document that is applied within 90 seconds after the commit option is ignored. During the countdown to rollback, the system sends the ASCII bell character each time it refreshes the countdown display, to provide an audible cue that rollback is about to start.

Scheduled jobs that are already executing will complete before pass-through starts, signaled by:

```
Process is executing. Please wait or press 'x' to exit. 
```

To exit pass-through mode, press the tilde character **~** and the enter key.

When you end your session, you will be prompted to enter a comment describing the reason for your changes if changes are detected.

```
