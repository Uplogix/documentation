This command saves the Alcatel device's configuration as the "certified" or known good configuration. If the device's configuration is changed in a harmful way later, you can return the device to the certified configuration using the **restore** command. 

While the device is using a certified configuration, you will not be able to use push or rollback commands.

The certify and restore commands are only applicable to Alcatel devices.
