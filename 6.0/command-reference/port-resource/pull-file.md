<!-- 5.4 -->

Used to pull ad-hoc files from managed device. The files are compared to the versions previously stored. If the content is different, the version stored as current is moved to previous, overwriting the existing previous version, and the new file is stored as current. 

The command line defined as the [remoteCmd] will be issued to the device and the tftp/sftp server will be started on the management IP address of the Local Manager 

Rules can be defined to automate this operation using the pull action.
