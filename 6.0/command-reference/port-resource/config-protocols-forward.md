Configures the SSH port forwarding settings.

SSH port forwarding enables access to network services running on the dedicated or management IP addresses of a managed device. Multiple users on multiple workstations can use SSH Port Forwarding concurrently.

To use SSH port forwarding, the managed deviceâ€™s management or dedicated IP address must be configured on the Local Manager. This can be configured using **config init** or **config info**.
