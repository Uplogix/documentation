# Syntax 

```
config password [â€œusernameâ€]

```

# Usage

If you use the command **config password** without including a username, this allows you to change your own password. The **config password â€œusernameâ€** command allows you to change the password for the specified user account without supplying the current password. You must have the appropriate privileges to change another user's password.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config password
Old Password:********
New Password [********]: ********
Confirm Password: ********
Password changed.

[admin@UplogixLM]# config password djones
New Password: ********
Confirm Password: ********
Password changed.
```

If the LM is managed by a Control Center, an error message will be displayed.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config password
Users may not be edited when the system is managed.
```

> **Note**: Do not create a password that ends with a space character. When you attempt to log in using a password that ends with a space, the Uplogix Local Manager strips the space character and the login fails.
