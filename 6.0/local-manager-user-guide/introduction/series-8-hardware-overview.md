The LCD screen and menu buttons have been moved to a modular card that can be installed in any expansion slot. 

## 8 Port Serial Card

![LM83X 8 Port Serial Card](https://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/6.0/lm83x-8-port-serial.png)

The 8 Port Serial Card adds 8 serial ports to the LM83X.

## 16 Port Serial Card

![](https://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/6.0/lm83x-16-port-serial.png)

The 16 Port Serial Card is used with 8 Port fan-out cables that have a v.68M connector for attaching to the card and 8 RJ-45 connectors pinned as DCE. Two of these cables can be used to connect the card to up to 16 devices. 

### 8 Port Fan-out Cable

![](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/installing-a-local-manager/fan-out-cable_with-stickers.png)

The fan-out cables come with a set of stickers for labeling. Wrap the stickers on the ferrite bead near the RJ45 connectors as shown above. The stickers allow you to label the cables with both slot and port numbers for easier identification. 

**IMPORTANT:** The numbering of the fan-out cables may not be in order from left to right. **ONLY** rely on the numbers on the labels at the end of the cables.  

## 8 Port Dedicated Ethernet Card

### Install an SFP module

Follow these steps to install the SFP module:

1.	Power off the Local Manager
2.	Remove the option slot cover, align the carrier card with the internal rails, and slide the module into place.
3.	Replace the screws.
4.	Install either a 1000Base SX (GLC-SX-MM) SFP or the 1000Base LX/LH (GLC-LH-SM) SFP for fiber connectivity. Both the 1000Base SX (GLC-SX-MM) SFP and the 1000Base LX/LH (GLC-LH-SM) SFP are customer-provided equipment. 

<div class='info'>SFP modules are hot swappable, but the SFP carrier option card is not hot swappable.</div>

![SFP module diagram](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/installing-a-local-manager/image010.png)

### Install a temperature and humidity sensor

Environmental monitoring is available via a USB-connected temperature and humidity sensor.

Follow these steps to connect the sensor. Note the Local Manager does not need to be powered down for installation of this sensor.

1.	Plug the sensor into one of the two USB connections on the Local Manager.
2.	Place sensor collection end in the area you wish to collect environmental information, ideally not near a fan or on hot equipment.

It may take up to 10 minutes for the sensor to normalize to the environmental temperature and begin reporting consistent data. 

## Install expansion cards
Use the following procedure to install or replace an expansion card.

<div class='warning'>Always power off the Local Manager before installing or removing expansion cards.</div>

1.	Power off the Local Manager.
2.	Using a #2 Philips screwdriver, loosen the module screws securing the blank faceplate or the option card to be replaced and remove it.
3.	Slide the new or replacement option card into place. Ensure the two module retention screws are threaded into the faceplate of the card. The screws will align to holes in the chassis if the screws are slightly backed out of the front panel. 
<div class='info'>Installing the option card with the screws fully engaged makes it difficult to install the card properly.</div> 

4.	Look inside the chassis and find two tabs close to the front of the option slot and two located further back. Place the rear edge of the card on the two front tabs, tilt the card up and slide it back so the card edges slide below the two rear tabs. Gently push the card back until the card seats in the connector on the backplane.
<div class='warning'>If it is difficult to slide the card or if the card resists being properly seated, the card is probably not installed correctly. Remove the card and start over. Very little force is required to install the cards.</div>

5.	Tighten the module retention screws to ensure that the internal connector seats properly. 
<div class='warning'>Over tightening the screws may strip the threads and is not required; finger tight is sufficient. As you install the retention screws, you may encounter some resistance. If needed, use a #2 Philips screwdriver to overcome this resistance but use care not to cross thread or strip the screw.</div>
6.	If you are installing a 16 port serial card, attach the supplied octopus cable to the connector on the front of the card.

## Connect to power

Before connecting the Local Manager to power, ensure all [site requirements](#site-requirements) are met.

Connect the power cord to the Local Manager. Use either the provided power cord or one that is suitable for your location. The Uplogix Local Manager uses a power cord with a standard IEC-320-C13 female cord end.

![A Power Cord](http://uplogix.com/support/docs/img/lm-user-guide/plug.png)
 
Connect the power cord to a power outlet. A dimly lit keypad and dark display (if installed) indicates that the unit has power applied. Power the unit on by pressing the middle keypad button. The display on the front panel will illuminate and display progress messages as the device boots. At the end of the boot sequence, it displays the message **Uplogix status good**.

## Installation complete

You are now ready to complete the initial setup of the Uplogix Local Manager.
