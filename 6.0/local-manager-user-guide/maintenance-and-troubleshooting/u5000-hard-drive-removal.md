For certain secure locations, it may be necessary to remove the Uplogix 5000's hard drive before sending the Local Manager back as part of an RMA. This article describes how to remove the hard drive from the chassis. The drive can then be destroyed; it does not need to be returned to Uplogix.

# 1. Remove Screws From Cover

Remove the 2 cover screws from the back of the u5000. Be careful not to strip the screws when removing and replacing.

# 7. Remove Mounting Bracket From Drive

Remove the **4** screws from the bottom of the hard drive mounting assembly. Place the mounting bracket inside the box with the chassis (but not in the chassis).
