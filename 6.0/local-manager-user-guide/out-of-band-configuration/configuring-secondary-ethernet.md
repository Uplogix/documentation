<div class='ucc' />Inventory > Local Manager Summary >Â Network > Secondary Ethernet</div>

In addition to modems, the Local Manager can use its secondary Ethernet port as an out of band channel.

# Usage Notes

* The secondary network must not conflict with the appliance's primary and dedicated networks. 
* The secondary Ethernet interface is turned off during in-band operation. The interface will not respond to pings until the out of band connection is enabled.
* Dial-in access via the modem is available through the **config answer** command. Dial-up PPP via the modem is disabled in this mode.

# Configure Outband Mode

To configure outband mode, run **config system secondary** from the system resource. When asked for type, use *outband*. Once outband is specified, options will become available for DHCP, speed/duplex, and DNS. If you are not using DHCP, the system will prompt for IP address, subnet mask, and default route.

## Using DHCP

The following example uses DHCP, auto-negotiated speed/duplex, static DNS, and no out-of-band sharing. 

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config system secondary
--- Existing  Values ---
Type: bonded
Bonding Link: yes
[E1] Primary Ethernet Link: yes (bonded active)
[E2] Auxiliary Ethernet Link: no (bonded)
[E3] Internal SFP Ethernet Link: no (bonded)
Change these? (y/n) [n]: y
--- Enter New Values ---
Type [bonded]: outband
Use DHCP (y/n) [n]: y
speed/duplex [auto]: 
Use DNS (y/n/auto) [auto]: 
Enable Out-of-Band Sharing (y/n) [n]: n
Warning: Remote connections may be lost if you commit changes.
```

## Using Static IP Addresses

To specify the out-of-band IP address, run **config system secondary** again and set DHCP to n

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config system secondary
--- Existing  Values ---
Type: bonded
Bonding Link: yes
[E1] Primary Ethernet Link: yes (bonded active)
[E2] Auxiliary Ethernet Link: no (bonded)
[E3] Internal SFP Ethernet Link: no (bonded)
Change these? (y/n) [n]: y
--- Enter New Values ---
Type [bonded]: outband
Use DHCP (y/n) [n]: n
Management IP: 192.168.1.1
Default Route: 192.168.1.254
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
speed/duplex [auto]: 
Use DNS (y/n/auto) [auto]: y
DNS Server IP 1: 192.168.1.254
DNS Server IP 2: 192.168.1.253
Domain Search: uplogix.local
Enable Out-of-Band Sharing (y/n) [n]: n

## Enabling Out-of-band Sharing

This feature is used with WAN Traffic Failover. Please contact Uplogix Support for more information.

# Enabling Outband Manually

To bring up the out-of-band interface, use the **outband on** command from the modem resource.

```
[admin@UplogixLM (modem)]# outband on
Secondary Ethernet Adapter is down.
Secondary network Local Address is 172.30.52.111
Out of Band is turned on.
```

The message *Secondary Ethernet Adapter is down* refers to the adapter's status prior to running outband on. If PPP is already up, the following message will be displayed.

```
[admin@UplogixLM (modem)]# outband on
Secondary Ethernet Adapter is up.
```

To turn off the outband connection, use the **outband off** command.

```
[admin@UplogixLM (modem)]# outband off
Out of Band is turned off
```

# Enabling Outband Automatically

The outband connection can be activated from built-in features like Pulse and through the rules engine. Note that while some commands continue to reference PPP, no PPP connection will be established.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config system pulse
--- Existing  Values ---
Use Pulse: false
Pulse Server IP 1: 127.0.0.1
Pulse Server Port 1: 7
Enable Out-of-Band on Pulse Failure: no
Change these? (y/n) [n]: y
--- Enter New Values ---
Use Pulse (y/n) [n]: y
Pulse IP 1 [127.0.0.1]: 10.10.10.1
Pulse Port 1 [7]: 
Pulse IP 2 [127.0.0.1]: 
Pulse Port 2 [7]: 
Pulse IP 3 [127.0.0.1]: 
Pulse Port 3 [7]: 
Enable Out-of-Band on Pulse Failure (y/n) [n]: y
Remain Out-of-Band after Pulse Success (y/n) [n]: n
Maximum Time Out-of-Band (0 means unlimited) [0]: 
Do you want to commit these changes? (y/n): 
```

If Pulse fails, the system will automatically enable the outband connection.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# show alarms

```

You can also use a rule to bring up the Secondary Ethernet connection. The following is a simplified example that turns outband on upon scheduling. Note that pppOn is specified as the action, but will have the same effect as **outband on**.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config rule pppAlwaysOn
[config rule pppAlwaysOn]# action pppOn
[config rule pppAlwaysOn]# action alarm -a "Enabling Secondary Ethernet OOB"
[config rule pppAlwaysOn]# conditions
[config rule pppAlwaysOn conditions]# true
[config rule pppAlwaysOn conditions]# exit
[config rule pppAlwaysOn]# exit

[admin@UplogixLM]# config monitor system pppAlwaysOn

Viewing Secondary Ethernet Status
```

You can use the **show status** command from the modem resource to view out of band information.

```
[admin@UplogixLM (modem)]# show status
Outband: Secondary Ethernet
Inactive

[admin@UplogixLM (modem)]# show status
Outband: Secondary Ethernet
Active: address 172.30.52.111, duration 10 minutes
```

# Disabling Outband Mode

To disable outband mode on Secondary Ethernet, run **config system secondary** from the system resource. When asked for type, use *bonded*.

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# config system secondary
--- Existing  Values ---
Type: outband
Use DHCP: No
Management IP: 192.168.1.1
Default Route: 192.168.1.254
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Speed/duplex: auto (no link)
MAC Address: 90:0F:2D:00:CB:C3
Use DNS: no
Enable Out-of-Band Sharing: no
