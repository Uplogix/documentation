# Overview

This document provides a list of Uplogix Local Manager Syslog messages and their corresponding level for Uplogix version 5.2. 

# Syslog 

Syslog messages can be sourced from the Local Manager's context as well as from a device port.  Each area can be configured to log to a different server, facility, and UDP port. Uplogix Local Manager specific logs are sourced as the Local Manager's facility. 

Device logs are collected from the console or buffered log and sent as the device port's facility.  All Syslog messages are sourced from the Local Manager's IP address.  

## Local Manager
 
This will include system and port level events including modem, outband, and power components. This is configured with the **config system syslog** command. An example of this type would be: 

```
Jan  31 22:20:36 local3: Host: A500560133 ; NOTICE: User login failed.
Jan  31 22:20:29 local3: Host: A500560133 Duration: 00:15:00 Count: 21; WARNING: Failed to connect to pulse server. (192.0.2.88:7)
Jan  31 22:21:30 local3: Host: hwvpn8; INFORMATIONAL: Port was locked
Jan  31 22:21:30 local3: Host: hwvpn8; WARNING: Terminal is locked. (rbuilder)
```

## Device

Each device port can be configured to send device log messages collected from the device's console port to a specific host. The **config device logging** command from the device's port is used to specify these settings:

```
Jan  31 22:29:20 local4: Host: hwvpn8 189243: *Jan 24 15:37:57.978 UTC: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list from_internet denied udp 203.0.113.75(137) (FastEthernet4 50e5.49b8.a010) -> 203.0.113.255(137), 4 packets

Jan  31 22:29:20 local4: Host: hwvpn8 189245: *Jan 24 15:38:57.978 UTC: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list from_internet denied udp 203.0.113.75(17500) (FastEthernet4 50e5.49b8.a010) -> 203.0.113.255(17500), 12 packets
```
 
> The current UTC time of the Local Manager is included in each message. The January 31 date is the current time on the Local Manager and the January 24 date (seen later in the message) was included in the text from the device.

# Message Structure

This is a list of available Syslog messages as of Local Manager version 5.2.  All Syslog messages are sent using Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
 
* Severity Level is sent as a single digit from 0 to 7, indicating the severity of the message.
	* 0 - Emergency
	* 1 - Alert
	* 2 - Critical
	* 3 - Error
	* 4 - Warning
	* 5 - Notice
	* 6 - Info
	* 7 - Debugging
* Equivalent SNMP Event - Each Local Manger Syslog can additionally be sent as an SNMP trap using the MIB definitions listed here.  See the MIB reference for more detail about this.
* Message - This is a text field. The Local Management software or rule authors may append additional information to these messages.
