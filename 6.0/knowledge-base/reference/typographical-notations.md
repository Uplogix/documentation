The following conventions are used in the Uplogix Documentation Library.

Sample text from the Uplogix command line interface is presented as preformatted text. For example:

```
[admin@UplogixLM]# show who
admin ssh Mar 22 13:38 (203.0.113.6)
```

Keyboard characters are enclosed in square brackets. For example, press [Enter].

Navigation paths to command equivalents on a Control Center are displayed with the green Uplogix logo. For example:

<div class='ucc' />Administration > Server Settings</div>

Local Manager and UCC CLI commands are present as **bold** text. For example, run the **config init** command.

Notes, Cautions, and Warnings are presented in colored boxes:

> This is a basic note.
 
<div class='warning' />This is a caution note.</div>

<div class='danger' />This is a warning note.</div>
